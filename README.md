# dijikstra

```
This is implementation of dijikstra algorithm using JAVA language.
It first asks if the user wants to start the algorithm to work, and reads the .lsa file that is stored in the same directory.
After reading the lsa file for the network topology information, three options are there as the next step.
1. Compute all  - Shows the shortest path for each node
2. Single Step  - Unlike the first one, it shows the step one by one.
3. Topology update  - Can add or remove nodes, and break the links between nodes

Repeates until the user wants to stop
